abstract="This paper presents an auction mechanism for energy trading between multiple microgrids. We consider a region consisting of multiple interconnected microgrids wherein given time t, some microgrids have excessive energy that they wish to sell, whereas other microgrids desire to buy additional energy to meet their local demands. In this paper, we introduce a combinatorial double auction mechanism for such trades to happen. The participants can bid as a combination of bids along with a single bid format. We also present a novel winner determination solution for combinatorial double auctions using evolutionary algorithms. Two algorithms combining genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization are presented in this paper. Price determination for each trade is also explained. Using MATLAB, performance evaluation and stability tests of the proposed auction technique are performed and presented.",

This paper presents a modelling method based on Open Data and Open Source. It is focused on a model of the high voltage grid of the German federal state Schleswig-Holstein. The developed model enables to perform static AC power flow simulations. Topological OpenStreetMap information is combined with literature-based assumptions of typical line data. Generation capacities were assigned to the grid buses using freely available registers. The demand was allocated to these buses using the correlating distribution of population. The output of the AC power flow simulations respectively bus voltages and line currents for different worst-case scenarios are presented, analysed and discussed. The results show the potential of scientific electricity grid modelling using Open Data and Open Source. Realistic grid congestion within the high voltage grid of Schleswig-Holstein was identified, providing a basis for further discussion. For a comprehensive validation of the simulated results relevant data need to be opened for the public.",

  abstract={There are several power grid modelling approaches suitable for simulations in the field of power grid planning. The restrictive policies of grid operators, regulators and research institutes concerning their original data and models lead to an increased interest in open source approaches of grid models based on open data. By including all voltage levels between 60 kV (high voltage) and 380kV (extra high voltage), we dissolve the common distinction between transmission and distribution grid in energy system models and utilize a single, integrated model instead. An open data set for primarily Germany, which can be used for non-linear, linear and linear-optimal power flow methods, was developed. This data set consists of an electrically parameterised grid topology as well as allocated generation and demand characteristics for present and future scenarios at high spatial and temporal resolution. The usability of the grid model was demonstrated by the performance of exemplary power flow optimizations. Based on a marginal cost driven power plant dispatch, being subject to grid restrictions, congested power lines were identified. Continuous validation of the model is nescessary in order to reliably model storage and grid expansion in progressing research.},

  abstract={European wholesale electricity prices have dropped by nearly two thirds since their all-time high around 2008. Different factors have been blamed, or praised, for having caused the price slump: the expansion of renewable energy; the near-collapse of the European emissions trading scheme; over-optimistic power plant investments; a decline in final electricity consumption; and cheap coal and natural gas. This ex-post study of European electricity markets from 2008 to 2015 uses a fundamental power market model to quantify their individual contributions on day-ahead prices. The two countries we study in detail, Germany and Sweden, differ significantly: fuel and CO2 prices were important price drivers in Germany, but in Sweden it was electricity demand. This difference is explained by the nature of the hydro-dominate Nordic electricity system. In both countries, however, the single largest factor depressing prices was the expansion of renewable energy. At the same time, Germany's nuclear phase-out had an upward effect on prices. If one defines the Energiewende as the combination of these two policies, its net effect on power prices was negligible.}

abstract="The research field of energy system analysis is faced with the challenge of increasingly complex systems and their sustainable transition. The challenges are not only on a technical level but also connected to societal aspects. Energy system modelling plays a decisive role in this field, and model properties define how useful it is in regard to the existing challenges. For energy system models, evaluation methods exist, but we argue that many decisions upon properties are rather made on the model generator or framework level. Thus, this paper presents a qualitative approach to evaluate frameworks in a transparent and structured way regarding their suitability to tackle energy system modelling challenges.",

abstract = {This paper presents a thorough review of 75 modelling tools currently used for analysing energy and electricity systems. Increased activity within model development in recent years has led to several new models and modelling capabilities, partly motivated by the need to better represent the integration of variable renewables. The purpose of this paper is to give an updated overview of currently available modelling tools, their capabilities and to serve as an aid for modellers in their process of identifying and choosing an appropriate model. A broad spectrum of modelling tools, ranging from small-scale power system analysis tools to global long-term energy models, has been assessed. Key information regarding the general logic, spatiotemporal resolution as well as the technological and economic features of the models is presented in three comprehensive tables. This information has been validated and updated by model developers or affiliated contact persons, and is state-of-the-art as of the submission date. With the available suite of modelling tools, most challenges of today's electricity system can be assessed. For a future with an increasing share of variable renewables and increasing electrification of the energy system, there are some challenges such as how to represent short-term variability in long-term studies, incorporate the effect of climate change and ensure openness and transparency in modelling studies.},
