\begin{itemize}
    \item Quality of electricity system modelling heavily relies on input data.
    \item Centralised and open provision of input data increases both transparency and efficiency.
    \item A lot of data is publicly available, but often dispersed and tedious to process.
    \item The Open Power System Data platform is an approach to tackles these challenges.
