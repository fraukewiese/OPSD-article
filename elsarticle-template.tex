\section{Introduction (Frauke)}
\label{Introduction}

\subsection{Need for quantitative power sector modelling}
Energy research as well as policy advice are based on quantitative computer models. The number of models, especially power sector models has increased significantly within the last years. With a rising amount of fluctuating renewable wind and solar power, temporal resolution has become increasingly important since only then flexibility of power plants can be taken into account. Studies based on power sector models include price i.a. forecasts, interplay of wind and solar, ramping requirements for thermal power plants, storage requirements or optimal configurations of 100\% renewable power sectors and their respective transition pathways.

\subsection{Extensive input data requirements}
The optimisation or simulations performed with these power plant models heavily depend on various input data. Since most investigations start from the conditions of the power sector today, generation capacities as well as time series of load, prices as well as wind and solar power generation are particularly relevant. Additional data requirements also include inter-connector capacities, fuel prices, hydro reservoir inflows, district heating demand or system service requirements or potentials for renewable sources. However, the intersection of data required for all power sector models are existing capacities as well as load time series and renewable power feed-in.

\subsection{Availability of data}
A lot of data is available - but dispersed, poorly documented and ill-formatted

Although energy data availability has grown over the last years, data search, processing and validation still constitutes a significant share of the work load of power system modelling. This is due to
\begin{itemize}
    \item the required combination of several different sources
    \item difficult discoverability
    \item manual download of different files
    \item merging of different file-formats and formatting
    \item lack of a standardised nomenclature and classification of energy technologies and sources
    \item poorly documented original data, e.g. lack of meta data
    \item quality of input data which require a verification process (e.g inconsistencies, obvious errors, gaps in data)
\end{itemize}

Additionally, many of they openly available data is subject to unclear or restrictive terms of use. Actually, confusion around copyright is one of the main challenges for data sharing \url{https://figshare.com/articles/Whitepaper_Practical_challenges_for_researchers_in_data_sharing/5975011}

Concluding, data processing, maintenance and verification is a major obstacle and work load for power system modellers. Since it is performed by different teams in parallel isolation, efficiency could significantly improve if done in collaboration. Also the quality of the processed data could significantly improve by knowledge sharing of the large amount of power system data users. The project \textit{Open Power System Data (OPSD)} aims at harvesting the efficiency and quality gain for the power modelling community by collecting, checking, processing, aggregating, documenting and publishing data required for power modelling on an online platform. 

The concept and methods of \textit{Open Power System Data} is described in section \re
{sec:OPSD}, while section \ref{sec:packages} explains the approach and content of the resulting five data packages. Finally, we reflect on the current usage of the data packages as well as possible extensions \ref{sec:discussion}.    f

\section{Results: Five data packages (vertextung folien abschlussworkshop...)}
\label{sec:packages}
\subsection{Overview}
Currently five main data packages are available, which cover a large share of the input data required for power system modelling. These are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conventional power plants
    \item National generation capacity
    \item Renewable power plants
    \item Time series
    \item Weather data
\end{itemize}

Due to different original data availability as well as processing effort, the geographical coverage differs. The covered countries in the different data packages are shown in blue in the data availability matrix (Figure \ref{fig:overview}). Further specifications on the start year of availability (time series) and type of power plants covered are indicated in the matrix cells.

Figure \ref{fig:energy_structure} displays the energy source structure we apply consistently to the first three packages.

\paragraph{Value added}

%  	This Data Package contains a list of renewable energy power plants in lists of renewable energy-based power plants of Germany, Denmark, France and Poland. Germany: More than 1.7 million renewable power plant entries, eligible under the renewable support scheme (EEG). Denmark: Wind and phovoltaic power plants with a high level of detail. France: Aggregated capacity and number of installations per energy source per municipality (Commune). Poland: Summed capacity and number of installations per energy source per municipality (Powiat). Switzerland: Renewable power plants eligible under the Swiss feed in tariff KEV (Kostendeckende Einspeisevergütung) Due to different data availability, the power plant lists are of different accurancy and partly provide different power plant parameter. Due to that, the lists are provided as seperate csv-files per country and as separate sheets in the excel file. Suspect data or entries with high probability of duplication are marked in the column 'comment'. Theses validation markers are explained in the file validation marker.csv. Filtering all entries with comments out results in the recommended data set. Additionally, the Data Package includes a daily time series of cumulated installed capacity per energy source type for Germany. All data processing is conducted in Python and pandas and has been documented in the Jupyter Notebooks linked below. 

\subsection{Time series (Jonathan)}
\label{subsec:time series}

\paragraph{Content and Scope}
The time series data package contains highly granular time series data, including the following variables:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Power consumption (load)
    \item Power generation by varaiable renewables (wind and solar) and share of production capacity 
    \item Day-ahead power prices
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Geographic coverage}
Overall, 35 countries are covered. coverage varies between variables, however and improves with time. While load data is published for all European countries, availability of renewable generation data varies between countries. While historic records of day-ahead prices could be purchased from power exchanges, they are freely available only since 2015, when the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform was introduced.

\paragraph{Value added}
While from 2015 onwards, many of the data are available from the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform, earlier records have to be obtained through individual national sources. Data are extracted mostly from national TSO's websites, ENTSO-E's "Monthly statistics data collection" as well as ENTSO-E Transparency. Data formats vary greatly depending on the source: Some TSOs allow downloading one file containing all available data (Amprion), while others require downloading and combining monthly (TenneT) or even daily files (PSE). Depending on the national market set-up, data have a resolution of either 15 (i.e. Austria, Germany and some neighbours), 30 (i.e. the British Isles) or 60 minutes (all other countries). The time series data package combines all data with the same temporal resolution in one file each, greatly fascilitating it's use for modellers. Additionally, 15 and 30 minute data are aggregated to 60 minutes in order to provide one file with maximal geographic coverage.

Power system modelling usually requires time series data to be complete for the period under consideration. Many time series however are missing data for periods ranging from a few hours to many months. Individual data are commonly missing during the daylight-savings time fall back in October. Within the time series data package, data gaps up to 2 hours are filled by applying linear interpolation. In these cases, tables are annotated with a marker, allowing users to trace back where interpolation has been applied. Longer periods of missing data are left as-is.

\subsection{Weather data (Frauke)}

\paragraph{Content and Scope}
The weather data package provides a script to automatically download and process wind, solar and temperature data based on the MERRA-2 dataset (TODO REFERENZ) made available by NASA (illustration: Figure \ref{fig:weather data}). It differs significantly to the other data packages as no one click-download of the already processed data is available on the platform. Due to the size of the data which can reach GB and TB if a high amount of variables, a long timespan and a huge geographical area is chosen, the strategy here is to provide a documented methodological script and a data sample for the year 2016 for Germany. The user is thus enabled to receive a chosen set of parameters of a specified area and time span, by running the script on the own computer. Resulting data can be formatted either in csv or sql-format. Parameters covered are
\begin{itemize}
 \item wind velocity in 2, 10 and 50 meters height and roughness length
 \item solar radiation
 \item temperature
 \item air density and pressure
\end{itemize}

Since the total top-of the-atmosphere horizontal and the ground radiation in the original data is not what a energy modeller requires to calculate the resulting energy yield of a solar power plant, the script provides methods to transform these to direct/indirect radiation.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/weather_data.png}
    \caption{Content and scope of the weather data script}
    \label{fig:weather data}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Geographic coverage}
The reanalysis data has worldwide coverage in a resolution of 0.625 x 0.5. By specifying two coordinates in the script, a rectangular area can be chosen.

\paragraph{Value added}
Weather parameter for modelling are crucial due to the rising influence of wind and solar feed-in for the power system. The OPSD weather data script fills a gap between original meteorological data (e.g. MERRA-2) and ready-made feed-in time series. On the one hand direct usage of original datasets require knowlegde which one to choose of the hundreds of meteorological parameters and how to receive wind speed and solar radiation relevant for power-modelling. Additionally, the NetCDF-file format preferred by meteorologist due to its mutlidimensional option, is not directly compatible with data formats preferred by power system modellers and requires thus tedious processing. On the other hand, feed-in time series as provided in the data package described in \ref{subsec:time series} are less flexible for the automatic integration to own modelling code and restricted to the assumptions made for the calculation of the resulting electricity feed-in like e.g hub height of wind turbines. Thus, for power modellers who have the ambition of own feed-in calculations and require a long timespan of historic weather data, this script lowers the barrier of utilizing the wealth of available reanalysis weather data.
        
\section{Discussion and Outlook (Lion)}
\label{sec:discussion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wolf: hier insbesondere auf laufende Erweiterungen etc. eingehen, möglicherweise auch auf Zielgruppen etc. 
    \item Statistics on how the data is applied, how many users etc., maybe categorize the applications
    \item MaybesShow verification/validation results of bottom-up power plant data with national statisticsja
    \item The approach of OPSD is reproducible, flexible, possible to update and widely apply
    \item quality of the data, room for improvement: what specific?
    \item maintenance work is required
    \item Procedure cannot be applied for all data required for energy system modelling, e.g. for grid stuff probably, there database approaches are also required
    \item tools and knowledge for reproducible data processing and metadata storage is there but data education (documentation, organisation) for energy system modellers is a bottleneck while important
    \item legal issue is central, examples of improvement, but data knowledge and knowledge of open licences for original data owners is lacking
\end{itemize}
